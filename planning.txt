//BRONZE PLAN 
1- Big Goals
    Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
    Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
    Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
    Build an application to a specification that someone else gives you
    Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer
    Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world

2-Technical Requirements
Your Tic Tac Toe app must:
    Render a game board in the browser 
    Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
    Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
    Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
    Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
    Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
    Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
    You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project
    Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
    Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

3- User Stories
    As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
    As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
    As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
    As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
    As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
    As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
    As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
